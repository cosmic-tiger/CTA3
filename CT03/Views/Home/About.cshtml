    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This project is a lightweight MVC starter app with view-scoped JavaScript, Bootstrap 5 styling, and no client-side frameworks. Built by Cosmic-tiger — painfully assisted with copilot.</p>
    <p>
        <div>
        When I say view-scoped javascript ...
        </div>
        <div>
        Each view like Index, Counter, FetchData, and About in your app is paired with a specific JS function and for specific ids:
        </div>
        <div>
        setupIndexView(), indexMain
        </div>
        <div>
        setupCounterView(), counterMain
        </div>
        <div>
        setupFetchDataView(), fetchDataMain
        </div>
        <div>
        setupAboutView(), aboutMain
        </div>
        <div>
        These javascript functions are defined globally, but they only run when the view contains specific markers eg a specific ids above, and a specific attribute.
        </div>

        <div>This is NOT an SinglePageApplication - it is a standard mvc, although, when getting data from service  (mock or live), the data is dynamically updated after doing a fetch().</div>
        <div>The next version one will be an SPA</div>
    </p>
