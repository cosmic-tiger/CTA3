# CTA3

aspnet core 8 mvc bootstrap5 quickstart template.

This solution mimics the very nice quickstart app provided by blazor.

To keep full file paths to a reasonable length, repo is called CTA3. Solution and folder are called CT03 (zero 3).

This solution was created using visual studio 2022, aspnetcore 8 LTS, uses bootstrap5 and bootstrap-icons.

I used client library (ie libman) to get bootstrap 5 and bootstrap icons. Ended up with weird stuff - no folder called "dist". etc.

Also, for some reason, the bootrap-icons.css is in the Font folder.

For fetchdata, there are three types of data: hard coded data (shown immediately as soon as view is loaded), mock data, and live data from the main Meteo weather api website.
